I Wrote code in Python for the analysis of biomolecule simulations. Specifically, we investigated protein-ligand unbinding using Molecular dynamics simulations.

    "description": "I did my PhD in the lab of Gioacchino Natoli, in the European Institute of Oncology, in Milan. Our work was focused on transcription regulation in higher eukaryotes. As a dry lab scientist, this involved building end-to-end pipelines for data processing and subsequent analysis, for which I wrote custom scripts in bash, R and python. XXXXHowever, my work didn't stop there. I read papers and discussed science extensively with my colleagues in order to design smart, targeted experiments that would give us the answers we need.",
