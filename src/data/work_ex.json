I Wrote code in Python for the analysis of biomolecule simulations. Specifically, we investigated protein-ligand unbinding using Molecular dynamics simulations.

    "description": "I did my PhD in the lab of Gioacchino Natoli, in the European Institute of Oncology, in Milan. Our work was focused on transcription regulation in higher eukaryotes. As a dry lab scientist, this involved building end-to-end pipelines for data processing and subsequent analysis, for which I wrote custom scripts in bash, R and python. XXXXHowever, my work didn't stop there. I read papers and discussed science extensively with my colleagues in order to design smart, targeted experiments that would give us the answers we need. XXXX What was my PhD about? I will put it briefly: about 2% of our genome contains the information that is transcribed into RNA that codes for proteins. However, a much larger fraction of the genome has the potential to be transcribed, but is actively suppressed as it could be detrimental to the cell. We studied the mechanism of this widespread transcription suppression. XXXXOur work is under review and will hopefully soon be published.",
